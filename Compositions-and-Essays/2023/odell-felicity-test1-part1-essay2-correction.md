George Santayana once said, "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it". One could argue that the meaning behind his statement is that humans as a society forget what has happened in the past and, because of this, is not able to learn from it, therefore human repeats the same errors and mistakes. It is not inconceivable to argue that the idea behind Santayana's phrase could be applied to people's individual lives as well in the sense that older generations' experiences are not taken into consideration as much as they should. Learning from their mistakes and success in relationships or even in work experiences could be a game changer in someone's life.

Young generations persistently disregard the experience of their older peers, for the reason that they might reason that their experience is outdated. While it might be true for some matters, it is not the case for relationships and work experiences.

When it comes to relationships, it could be wise for someone to consult an older peer, such as one's grandparents to seek advice. This can be insight since they probably had gone through a lot of situations, bad and good, in this matter. 

Besides this, older people can give really good advice when it comes to work experience. Nowadays we have several professions that were as valuable in the past as it is now, such as doctor, lower or teacher. Older people who have experience in such professions can also provide good information for the younger ones.

In conclusion, older people's experiences should never be overlooked, because they can provide enlightening advice that can be proven to be a life changer.
