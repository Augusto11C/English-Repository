# 06-10-2020 - Book Review

**Step 1: planning**
Writing a book review can be hard work if you don't plan certain details of your process. When writing a book review, you should have some aspects in mind:

-   What do you know about the book? How could you summarize the highlights of the book without giving much of the plot away to the reader? Remember the number 1 rule of a great review: Thou shall not spoil the book!"
-   How can you make the book plot appealing to your reader?
-   What type of book is it? What is the main theme?
-   How can you describe the style of writing?
-   What do you know about the writer and the context in which the story was written?

**Step 2: luring the reader**

The aim of the first paragraph is to lure the future reader into giving the book a try. It has to give a description of the setting and a brief summary of the plot. You could try to use persuasive language, filled with rhetoric questions to let the reader thinking and thirsty for more.

**Step 3: theme and style**

In this paragraph, you should write about the general theme of the book, and the style in which it is written. If the future reader wasn't attracted by the book yet, this is the time to convince him/her.

**Step 4: final recommendation**

in the final paragraph, it's the moment for you to give your personal view on the book. Time to show the beautiful descriptive language you have learned.

The Man in the High Castle
Novel by Philip K. Dick

In 1947, the US surrendered to the Axis superpowers Germany and Japan, ending the Second World War. Life now is dictated and controlled by the totalitarian rules imposed by war winners. A cold-war has started between Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany. Maybe you are wondering to yourself. "Am I read it right? The US being defeated and the Nazis and Japaneses won the second world war in 1947? Cold war between Japan and Germany ? -  Madness!".  

Well, this novel is a tremendous reflection and assumption about how the world would be like if the Allies have lost the war against the Axis powers in World War II. Written in eye-catching prose, the novel takes place fifteen years after the end of the war, and show the life of distinct characters such as a nazi General that once was an American soldier and now chases enemies of the government, a Japanese minister who was assigned to work in San Francisco to keep the American west coast under control, but starts to questioning his government methods to treat the surrendered people, a judo teacher that join the resistance after seeing her husband being hunted and killed by the nazis soldiers for being Jude, and more other brilliant characters.

The most captivating feature of the novel is how each character connects to each other throughout the story and the way it happens.

I cannot recommend more this book if you are looking for some story action-packed adventure with an unbelievable plot twist on the history and lots of suspense.
