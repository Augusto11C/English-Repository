Should we create more socially mixed residential areas, where rich people live next to poorer people, instead of in separate communities?
In order to answer this question, we, firstly, must examine why high-income and low-income earners do not share the same residential areas since from the start. Historically, cities have always presented some type of polarized characteristic associated with classes or groups that differ mainly by their economic capital. There are several studies and researches that show why it happens and some of then has as conclusion that the polarization occurs involuntarily, it is made by the social and economical differences that make rich and middle-class people live in some areas and poor people in others (normally irregular and with bad infrastructure).

In my opinion, the creation of mixed residential areas could bring many benefits for the community residents as well as for the city, generally speaking. It is noticeable that, the richest districts have better resources and facilities such as schools, parks, hospitals, and transport systems than the poorer ones. By incentivizing the mixture, more of those structures would be available around the city making its available for the low-income people, therefore, enabling their quality of life to be leveraged by this modern and better structure.

Admittedly, more violence can be associated with poor neighborhoods and, therefore, some citizens think twice before moving to these mixed areas, as there is a possibility of encountering a more dangerous neighborhood.

Although the idea of creating and encouraging mixed residential areas at first seems difficult to achieve and perhaps there are so many barriers in the way of making it a doable task, I believe that the long-term result is the main motivating factor in making it considerable for governments and even for citizens because there will be so many advantages in doing this, such as an infrastructure better distributed around the city, more people will have access to these infrastructures, the quality of life will improve, there will be a reduction of irregular areas being used for construction of houses, etc.
