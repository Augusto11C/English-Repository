Should public works of art be more widely encouraged in cities? If so, how should that happen?

To answer this question, we must first understand whether such an initiative could bring any benefit to the inhabitants of the city or if it would just be a waste of resources and space. Some researches indicate that city layout could influence indirectly with the mood and behavior of its citizens. By introducing art in places where its visual characteristics are not attractive, it could recreate the environment and, indoing so, could minimize the impacts that a not very well constructed region has on the people that live in there.

In my view, an initiative that encourages the creation of public works of art to be spread throughout the city is a notable movement. Cities gain value through public art, whether economic, cultural or political. Moreover, it can be a new way of instigating reflection in society by adding meaning to the city through these works.

Despite being an initiative with many benefits, as art is subjective, depending on the work to be exhibited, some people may be offended. Therefore, some care must be taken before we go ahead with this idea.

Although the idea of creation of public works might bring some discussion about some people being offended, I believe that the good results of this initiative can recreate our city in several ways - be it visual, behaving or even the way citizens think.
