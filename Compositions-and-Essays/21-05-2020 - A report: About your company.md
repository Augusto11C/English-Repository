### Assessment of the degree of satisfaction of employees and the local community about Augment Technologies

The present report has as foremost purpose layout the opinion of Augment's employees as well as the opinion of the local community about Augment Technologies as a company and its contribution to their lives and growth.

The ideas and data shown in this assessment were gathered from surveys and interviews carried out by the human resource department with employees and residents of the local community including small businesses established locally.
The survey applied in the research is composed of quantitative questions such as  "On a scale of zero to five, with zero beings **strongly disagree** and five means **strongly agree, how proud are you to work for Augment Technologies?". Also, qualitative questions were part of the survey and some of the examples of questions asked are: "Are there some things we are doing great here?", "Is there something else you think we should have asked you in this survey?".
The result was divided into two main categories, the first which was called Staff Perspective reunite the main points of satisfaction, sadness, and dissatisfactions about the company for the employees.  The second called "Perspective of the local community" contains analyzes of what is known about the company by the local community, in addition to their opinions about it.

By dividing the data collected in these two categories is easier to use the results obtained can be directed at the identification of both internal problems and external problems.

### Staff Perspective
According to the data provided by the study, there are a number of issues pointed out by the employees, in particular related to a nonclear way to transmit information about career plan, company's strategy/actions, and marketing.
The Lack of career development was the key spot of dissatisfactions among the answers, followed by the ineffective markets campaign, and no transparency about the company's strategy.

Notwithstanding the negative points raised by the employees, many positive aspects of the company were mentioned, for instance,  the flexible work hours, the innovative office environment, and well-paid vouchers for meals.

### Local Comunity Perspective
Regarding the local community perspective, two interrelated themes were discovered. The first is that services executed and provided by Augment Technologies are not well known by the locals. Most respondents are unaware of the services. 
The second major theme that is connected with the first is that none of the respondents saw or recognize some actions of the company for the locality.
 
 The facts presented above lead us to two major conclusions, being the first the necessity to create means to offer a more clear carrier path in the company, and transmit information regarding company's decisions and strategy goals in a more transparently way, 

Last in order, the second conclusion denotes the increase in the company's contribution to the local community.
