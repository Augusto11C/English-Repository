# 12-04-2021 - Show Review (CW1 - Mack 3)

Some months after the beginning of the pandemic, a festival of electronic dance music called Digital Mirage got attention on the internet. The event would be completely online, with no agglomeration of people. Its lineup was stunning, counting on worldwide popular DJs such as Don Diablo, Alok, Tiesto, and much more.

The event started on Friday at 6 PM and finished only on Saturday at 4 AM. Regarding my opinion about it, my initial thoughts were not so confident in its quality, because I have never seen this kind of show before, so the expectations were not so high.

The platform used to stream the event showed thousands of people were watching. Exactly at 6 PM, the scream started to show someone’s backyard, and a person suddenly appeared on the scream, it was Gryffin, one of my favorite DJs, at this point the show had started with one of his iconic songs “Gravity II Tour Intro”.

I could not see the reaction of the other participants, but I was astonished. The festival continued with several other DJs playing their songs and remixes from their homes. Some of them played from their living room, others from their roof, and there was even a subaquatic performance from Chet Porter, who had played from his swimming pool. 

I cannot say that this was 100% good, because a few minor issues happened with some of the participating artists, there were problems with either their sound system or internet connection.

The festival ended with one of the best DJs in the world, Don Diablo, playing from his house in an environment set up that was an outstanding one, he made it look like a spaceship, which gave a special feeling for the fans. The last song of his performance "We Are Love" and everybody in the comment session went wild. I can say that the Digital Mirage surprised me a lot and I recommend everyone to give it a try when it happens again.
