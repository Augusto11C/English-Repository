Do you know what children used to think some minutes before the end of the class at 13:00 in 2006~2008? Well, if you do not know I will tell you. They used to think "what I and my friends are going to play today after lunch?"

It was one of the most exciting thoughts that a child could have at that time, thinking about tons of games to play outside, activities, and challenges. 

I am proud to say that part of my childhood used to be exactly like that, I used to be wondering "what will my friends and I do today?" And after lunch, I would spend all the afternoon playing around with the other kids from the neighborhood. It was a really good moment in my life. At that time I made good friendships that continue today, learned lots of things, mainly how to interact and be together with others. 

The second part of my childhood was completely different, it was the period that has just started the "PlayStation era", a period that video games became extremely popular among children, I believe that in this moment of my life I have experienced what children today experience as childhood. Activities, games, and interactions done practically focused on two things, video games and television, however, for reasons of modernity, the television in my time became today's internet (youtube, Netflix, TikTok, etc) nowadays. During this period, I had a lot of fun, however, I had some problems as well, such as became a more introverted and indoor person.

This last stage reflected massively in my lifestyle and behavior in adolescence. I became a homely and extremely shy person. However, I wouldn't say it was bad, actually, I would say it was the opposite because I recognize that thanks to this new “Augusto”, I had the tools to focus on my studies (since I spend most of my time in my house) and be approved in a public university. 

I believe that both stages had a profound impact on what I am now and I am very grateful to them, because in each moment I learned many things, and I try to combine the best parts of them and apply them in myself today.
