# Exam Strategy and Techniques for Part 3

<details>

<summary>Part 3 - Long Turn Structure</summary>

In Part 3, you and the examiner discuss issues related to the topic in Part 2 in a more general and abstract way and, where appropriate, in greater depth.



Part 3 lasts 4â€“5 minutes.



This part tests your ability to explain your opinions and to analyse, discuss and speculate about issues.



The examiner is probably going to ask 4-5 questions. Therefore, there will be a minute to answer each question.

### Answer's Structure 1

1. Opinion.
2. Reason.
3. Example.
4. Consequences.

* **Example:**

> Well, I'd say the biggest change is that they have moved online. (opinion)&#x20;
>
> Because they have had to keep up with social media as a means of spreading news. (reason)&#x20;
>
> For example, I used to read the Guardian newspaper, the paper version, but now I read it via their app on my mobile phone. (example)
>
> I think, by moving online, the big newspapers have been able to actually grow their readership. The negative consequence I guess, is that they can no longer charge because everyone expects things to be free on the Internet. (consequence)



### Answer's Structure 2 - When You Do not Know How to Answer

If in the exam you just go blank and you have nothing to say, don't say nothing. Even if you have got nothing to say just tell the examiner that you have got nothing to say.



* **Example:**

> I just can't think, I've never thought about it before. Gosh it's a really tricky topic, let me think for a minute.
>
> No, my mind has gone a blank.
>
> I really don't have anything to say.
