# Exam Strategy and Techniques for Part 2

<details>

<summary>Part 2 - Long Turn Structure</summary>

The examiner gives you a task card which asks you to talk about a particular topic. The card tells you what points you should include in your talk and instructs you to explain one aspect of the topic. **You have one minute to prepare your talk**, and the examiner will give you a pencil and paper to make notes.

By using the points on the task card and making notes during the preparation time, you should be able to think of appropriate things to say, and have time to structure your talk so that you keep talking for 2 minutes.

The examiner will then ask you to begin talking and will stop you when the time is up. They may then ask you one or two questions on the same topic.

**Part 2 lasts 3â€“4 minutes, including the preparation time.**

### Tip 1 - Use all the time you are given to prepare

* **Focus on the Idea**
  * **Example:** "Describe an interesting person you know."
  * **Action:** Do not waste time deciding who you are going to describe.
* Think about the structure -> "what you are going to say"
  * Set the scene.
  * Describe the characters.
  * The action.
  * The outcome.
  * See more in [How to Structure Your Line of Though](exam-strategy-and-techniques-for-part-2.md#how-to-structure-your-line-of-though).
  * **Example:** "Describe an interesting person you know."
  * **Action:** (1) Who is he?, (2) Why is he interesting?, (3) How do I feel about him?



### Tip 2 - Use examples and short anecdotes

* **anecdotes:** short personal story.
* Use **anecdotes** to examplify (do not tell an anecdote longer than 30s).
* **Example:**
  * > Uncle Bob, right, he set up a business. He has never done business before, and he set up a business selling chairs. He rented this place and he started buying and selling chairs.



### Others Tips

* Tip 3: get to the point.
* Tip 4: Stay on topic.
* Tip 5: Do not worry if the examiner interrupt.
* Tip 6: Do not memorize a story or talk.
* Tip 7: Imagine (imagine the person, thing, place, event you are talking about).



### Tip 9 - Avoid having one story to cover many answers

* Example: You have a story about a time you went to a concert.
  * > I can use it when I am asked to describe a famous singer.&#x20;
    >
    > I can also use the same story if I am asked to describe a friend I have, because I have this friend who went to the concert with me.&#x20;
    >
    > I can also use the same story to describe a colourful place I went to, because the concert hall was really colourful.
