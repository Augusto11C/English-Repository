# Part 2 - Individual long turn

### What IELTS Part 2 is about?

The examiner gives you a **card with a topic** written on it and some prompts to help you with your answer. You are also given a pencil and a piece of paper to make notes if you wish. You have one minute to think about the topic and prepare your answer.

Then, you must **speak about the topic** for one to two minutes. The examiner may stop you if you speak longer than this. After you finish talking, the examiner may ask you one or two follow-up questions.
