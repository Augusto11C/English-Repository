#### When Answering a Question in Part 3, Follow this Structure

**Opinion -> Reason -> Example -> Consequence**

* **Example 1:  "**_How have newspapers changed in recent years?"_
  * "Well, I'd say the biggest change is that they have moved online" (**opinion**).
  * "Because they have had to keep up with social media as a means of spreading news" (**reason**).
  * "For example, I used to read the Guardian newspaper, the paper version, but now I read it via their app on my mobile phone" (**example**).
  * "The negative consequence I guess, is that they can no longer charge because everyone expects things to be free on the Internet" (**consequence**).

#### What can you say when you don't have enough knowledge about a topic to formulate an answer?

* "_I just can't think, I have not thought about that before. Gosh, It is a really tricky topic, let me think for a moment. No, **my mind's gone a blank**, I really don't have anything to say_".
