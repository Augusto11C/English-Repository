## Grammar

### Perfect Aspect

* Use something that started in the past and continues in the present - Use with stative verbs (e.g. be, have, know). This use is very similar to how we use the present perfect continuous, and often it's possible to use either tense. Of course, with stative verbs, **we can't use the present perfect continuous.**

> Have you seen Helen today?
> We have bought a new car this week.
> have you spoken to Michael this week?

* **Using Present Perfect when talk about *How Much* or *How Many* **
