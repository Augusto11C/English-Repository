## Describe important past events in your life and likely futures events
In 2005 I was 8 years old. At that time, I was studying at Colégio Cavlac. Since that time I have been interested in technology.

In 2014, I **attended** a private school called Colégio Argumento. I **used to** walk to and from school every day. Although I **had been playing** video games since 2010, that year, I found myself playing video games far more than I should have. The turning point for me to break free from the  grips of this addiction was after I failed my college entrance exams. Since then, I have been avoiding playing games. 

In 2015, I did a preparation course.

In 2016, I was accepted into one of the most prestigious universities in Brazil to study Information Systems, the course of my choice, at USP. At the time, and probably still today, what made me choose this course was my deep interest in the IT industry.

Being accepted by USP was a thrilling achievement for me. When I look back on how hard I worked to earn the opportunity to study in that university, it still gives me goosebumps to this day.

2017 was a year very special for me because I got my first job as a software developer, I was hired by LG Eletronics as an intern. Before that, I worked as a salesman.

In 2018/2019, I received my first full-time job offer. The company that made the offer was the largest investment bank in Latim America, BTG Pactual. I was really impressed by the opportunity, the salary and the benefits. The position I was offered was an entry-level position as a software developer position to work on one of BTG's biggest projects, building its digital bank system. At the time I hadn't (~~haven't~~) yet graduated from the university, therefore I had to juggle (~~conciliante~~) my studies with my full-time job, which was really hard, because the remaining university disciplines were higly demanding as was (~~as well as~~) my job, which required a lot of overtime (~~several extra-hours~~) due to its complexity and aggressive deadlines (~~due-dates~~). I almost failed in some of the disciplines(~~got repproved in some disciplines(~~) I was enrolled in university, however I manage to score the bare minimum to be approved in the final exams. After a lot of hard-work and suffering (lol) I manage to graduate at the end of 2019, ranked 10th in my class. I was really relieved to graduate, because it was one of my greatest challenges so far in my life, also I was overjoyed to be able to graduate from USP without failing once in any discipline (~~without beeing reproved in any discipline once~~).
