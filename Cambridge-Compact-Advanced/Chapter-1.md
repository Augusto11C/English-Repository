## Describe important past events in your life and likely futures events
In 2005 I was 8 years old. At that time, I was studying at Colégio Cavlac. Since that time I have been interested in technology.

In 2014, I **attended** a private school called Colégio Argumento. I **used to** walk to and from school every day. Although I **had been playing** video games since 2010, that year, I found myself playing video games far more than I should have. The turning point for me to break free from the  grips of this addiction was after I failed my college entrance exams. Since then, I have been avoiding playing games. 

In 2015, I did a preparation course.

In 2016, I was accepted into one of the most prestigious universities in Brazil to study Information Systems, the course of my choice, at USP. At the time, and probably still today, what made me choose this course was my deep interest in the IT industry.

Being accepted by USP was a thrilling achievement for me. When I look back on how hard I worked to earn the opportunity to study in that university, it still gives me goosebumps to this day.

2018 was a year very special for me because I got my first job as a software developer, I was hired by LG Eletronics as an intern. Before that, I worked as a salesman.
