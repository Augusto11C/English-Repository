## Grammar
### Enough, quite, so, such and too
Five of the most common modifiers are:  _enough, quite, so, such_  and  _too_.

1. **_Enough_  means 'the right amount or number'.** 
	A. It goes after an **adjective** or an **adverb**:
	- _I'm not tall enough to reach the top shelves._
	- _Don't worry. Your English is good enough to pass the exam._

	B. It also goes before nouns:
	- _There aren't enough eggs for the cake. Could you buy some more?_

	C. Use  _too/enough + for_  + phrase:
	- _The weather is too cold for the children._
	- _Are there enough sweets for all the kids?_

	D. Use _too/enough_  + infinitive:
	- _Do you feel strong enough to climb the hill?_
	- _'Have you got any money?' 'I haven't got enough (money) to buy everything.'_

2.  **_Too_ means 'more than is necessary or wanted'.**
	A. It is used before an adjective or adverb:
	- _I can't work with Joe. He does things too slowly._
	- _You're too young to go to clubs at night, Jimmy._

3.  **_Quite_  can mean 'fairly':**
	_I was quite surprised to learn he had failed the exam._

	**However**, in formal English, when it is used with non-gradable adjectives like:  _absurd, dead, true_, etc. it means 'completely'or 'totally':

	- _I think the whole idea is quite absurd._
	-  _What you say is quite true._

4. **_So_  generally used to emphasize what we say.**
	- _It was so hot that we decided to stay at the hotel._

	A. We can use it before an adjective or an adverb:
	- _He drove so quickly that the police stopped him._

	B. It can be used before  _much, many, few_  and  _little_:
	- _There were so many people that we couldn't get into the theatre._
	- _I regret it so much!_

5.  **_Such_  is also used to emphasize what we are talking about but we use it before adjective + noun:**
	- _I had such a bad day yesterday that I decided to go to bed early._

	A. We can also use it before a noun on its own:
	- _They made such a mess of everything that we couldn't find a solution._
	- _I've never seen such foolishness before! It's unbelievable!_

**Remember!**

A. Use  _so much_  before comparatives:
- _She looks so much happier now that she's moved into her house._

B. _Too_  can be used as a synonym of  _very_  in informal speech:
- _It's too kind of you to help me._
