## Grammar

### May, Might, Could
**Present and future possibility**

1. We use  _may, might_  and  _could_  to say that **perhaps something is true** at the moment of speaking or that **perhaps something will happen in the future**:

	_'Where's Dad?' 'He could be in the garden.'_  (= Perhaps he is in the garden.)

	_We may/might go to the theatre tomorrow._  (= Perhaps we will go to the theatre.)


	||  |  |
	|-- |--|--|
	||Most sure =  _may_|
	||Less sure =  _might_|
	||Least sure =  _could_  |  


2. We use the **negative forms**  _may not/might not_, **but NOT  _couldn't_, to mean that something negative is possible**:

	_They may not give me the job._  (= Perhaps they won't give me the job.)

3. We can also use  _may/might/could be_  +  _-ing_:

	_Be careful! Someone might/may/could be watching us._

**Possibility in the past**

1. We can use  _may/might/could_  +  **have**  + *past participle* to talk about possibility in the past:

	_They didn't reply to my job application form. It may/might/could have got lost in the post._  (= Perhaps it got lost in the post.)

	*Why did you drive so fast? You may  have killed yourself.*

**Remember!**

_May, might_  and  _could_  can be followed by continuous and perfect forms:

_They may/might/could be watching TV._

_They may/might/could have gone out._

### Be Likely and Be Possible
**Be likely**

1. We can use  _be likely_  + **infinitive** with ***to***  to talk about things that are probably **going to happen or that are probably true:**

	_He's likely to get the job because he's got a lot of experience._

	_It's likely to be a long meeting because there's a lot to discuss._

2. We can also use  _be more than likely_  + infinitive with  _to_  to mean `almost certain`:

	_It's more than likely she'll see Tom this week._  (= It's almost certain she'll see Tom this week.)

3. We can also use  _be likely_  +  _that_  ...:

	_It's likely that they'll arrive late due to the heavy traffic._

**Be possible**

1. We can use  _It's possible_  + infinitive with  _to_  to express possibility:

	_On a clear night it is possible to see as far as the coast._

2. We can also use  _It's possible_  +  _that_  ... to say that **something might happen** or be **true**, or to **talk about** a possible **past event**:

	_It's possible that we'll finish the project early._
	
	_It's possible that the email was sent to the wrong person._

3. We can use  _It's just possible that_  ... to say that something might happen or be true, but **it is not very likely**:

	_It's just possible that he didn't know about the meeting but I'm sure I told him._

4. We can use  *It's possible **for***  + person + infinitive with  _to_  to say that someone is able to do something or to **make polite requests**:

	_It's possible for some employees to work from home._

	_Is it possible for us to see the manager?_

**Remember!**

We can use  _be likely_  with a range of subjects (_I/you/he/she_, etc.), but  _be possible_  is only used with  _it_.

**Learning tips**

Watch/Read the news and say what is likely to happen in each story.

Think of five polite requests that you made recently and write what you could have said using  _Is it possible for me/us ... ?_
