## Grammar
### The / The Comparatives
Used for saying that when a particular activity, feeling, etc. increases, it causes something else to change at the same time

1) Used with a verb :
`The + comparative expression  + subject + verb.`
- The more I work, the more tired I am.
- The more I talk, the less you listen.
- The longer they waited, the more anxious they became 

2) Used with an adjective :
`The + adjective in the comparative + subject + verb.`
- The older he grows, the more impatient he becomes. 
- The **higher** you climb, the more dangerous it becomes
- The **less high** you climb,  the less difficult  it will be.
- The stronger the coffee, the better
- The bigger the risk, the greater the reward.
	- Notice this sentence is also in the past tense. Past and present tenses are common in these comparatives.

3) Used with a noun :

- The more chocolate he eats, the **fewer** sweets he will need.
	- 'Chocolate' is an uncountable noun (that you can't count) => **the more + uncountable**.(more  + countable/uncountable = big quantity). On the contrary, 'sweet', is  a **countable** noun. (Sweets can be counted.) therefore, this word MUST BE PRECEDED by **FEW** 

- the fewer + countable
- the less + uncountable

**More examples**
- The less chocolate he eats, the more sweets he will ask for
- The more exercises you do, the fewer mistakes you'll make. 
- The more games our soccer team won, the more attention we got on social media.

### Ever as Suffix for  Wh-words

- You can call in **whenever** you like. (= any time, it doesn't matter when)
- I'll follow you **wherever** you go. (= any place, it doesn't matter where)
- **Whichever** bus you take from this bus stop will take you home. (= any bus, it doesn't matter which)
- you can choose whichever package suits you best

#### How + ever == in whatever way:

Ever can also be added to how with a similar meaning:

- However you pay, in cash, by debit card or by credit card, you'll get a 10% discount. (= it doesn't matter how)
- There is something here to execite you, however adventures you are 
- There is no pressure - you can spend your time however you want
