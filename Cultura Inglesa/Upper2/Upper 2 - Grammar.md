the structure of the reported clause depends on whether the speaker is reporting a **statement, a question or a command.**

* [indirect form] The pilot commented that the weather had been extremaly bad. 
* [direct form] The weather was extremaly bad.

**Ex. 2:** 
* [indirect form] I told my mother I didn't a birthday party.

### Reporting Questions

#### Yes/No Questions
* **Structure**: reporting clause + reported clause introduced by **if** or **whether**. The **reported clause** is  in **statement form**.

 **Ex. 1:** 
* [indirect form] The waiter asked **if** we wanted a table near the window
* [direct form] 'Do you want a table near the window', the waiter asked me. 

 **Ex. 2:**

* My mother asked what we were doing [What you are doing?]



## Participle Clauses  
A participle clause is a dependent clause which **uses** a **participle form of a verb**. These clauses are used to avoid overly complicating sentences by assigning the same subject matter as the main clause to the participle clause.

Participle clauses give information/express:
* **condition** (with a similar meaning to an if-condition)
> Looked after carefully, this coat will keep you warm through many winters.
> if you look after it carefully, this coat will keep you warm through many winters.
> 
> Studying hard, I am sure you will pass.
> If you study hard, I am sure you will pass.

*  **result** (with a similar meaning to so or therefore)
> A car ran over a crowd. Injuring several people.
> A car ran over a crowd so several people were injuried

*  **reason** (with a similar meaning to because or since)
> I had not enoght time to sleep, having spent so long doing my work

*  **time** (with a similar meaning to words like when, while or as soon as)
> Sitting at the cafe with my friends, I suddenly realised that I had left the oven on at home.
>( _While I was sitting at the cafe with my friends, I suddenly realised that I had left the oven on at home._)

There are two time tenses that can make participle clause.  
• **Present participle (verb in ing form)**  
  
• **Past participle (passive meaning)**  
  
### Tips for Present participle (-ing)

### Tips for Past participle (-ing)

> **Schoked** by the explosion, the people ran away
> (_The people were shocked by the explosion and ran for shelter_)
>  
>  The musicians stood up, **surrounded** by thunderous applause.
>  ((_The musicians stood up while they were surrounded by thunderous applause._))

### Functions of Participle Construction

#### 	adjectival use
> I saw an exicit**ing** film [Present Participle]
> The destroy**ed** village was my hometown [Past Participle]

#### instead of relative clauses
**Ex. 1:**
* Construction using **relative clause**
> The actor who plays in the movie is not a native American
* Construction using Participle Clause
> The actor play**ing** in the movie is not a native American

**Ex. 2:**
* Construction using **relative clause**
> There is an exciting TV show which is being produced on Brazilian territory
* Construction using Participle Clause
> There is an exciting TV show being produced on Brazilian territory

#### Shortening Adverbial Clauses
* Construction using **relative clause**
>As they didn't know anything about their culture, most settlers didn't like the indians
* Construction using Participle Clause
> Not knowing anything about their culture, most settlers didn't like the indians

Ex:  
• Properly applied, this cream works wonders  
  
### having + past participle  
If we wish to emphasise that one **action was before another** then we can use a perfect participle (having + past participle):  

> Having brushed my teeth, I realised I hadn’t used my toothbrush.
> PS:
	> brush {escovar} - brushed [past participle] {escovado}
