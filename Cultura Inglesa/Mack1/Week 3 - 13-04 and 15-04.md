## Grammar

### Adverbs Word Order
Adverbs can go in initial position (at the beginning of a sentence), mid-position (with the verb) or in final position (at the end of the sentence). Some adverbs can only go in one position, some can go in two and some in all three of them.

1. **Initial position**

Adverbs that link a sentence to a previous one, time adverbs and negative expressions (followed by inversion) can go at the beginning of a sentence:

>_I'm too busy to do that. Besides, I'm not qualified._
_Today we're going to visit the Tower of London._
_Not only was the food awful, but also it rained all the time._

2. **Mid-position**

Mid-position adverbs usually go before the main verb (between the main verb and the auxiliary if there is one) and after _be_:

>_They completely forgot._
_I have just arrived._
_This meeting is mainly about planning._

**A)** Adverbs that indicate **certainty**, **completeness**, **indefinite frequency and adverbs of manner** (especially in passive sentences) can go in mid-position:

>_I will probably see you there._
_The building had been entirely gutted._
_I sometimes think he's insane._
_Ann single-handedly arranged the whole event._

**B)** When there are **two or more auxiliaries**, the a**dverb usually goes after the first one**:

> _She would never have found out if you had kept your mouth shut._

**WARNING!** However, adverbs of manner and of completeness go after all the auxiliaries:

	_It was the first time a project like that had been properly done._

**C)** In negative sentences, in short answers or when the auxiliary is used instead of the whole verb, mid-position adverbs go before the auxiliary:

>_I don't like her and I never will._
_'Do you agree?' 'I most certainly do not.'_

3. **End position**

Adverbs of **manner, place and time** often go in end position:

>_She closed the door quietly._
_I'll see them next month._
_I've left my glasses upstairs._

When there is **more than one adverb** in the end position, **the order:** *is manner, place and time*:

>_He hurt himself badly in the garden yesterday._

**Remember!**

When an adverb can go in different positions, sometimes there is a difference of meaning:

>_I don't really want to do this._ (= mild objection)
_I really don't want to do this._ (= strong objection)
