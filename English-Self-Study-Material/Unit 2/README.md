### Grammar `verb + -ing` forms (gerunds)

We can use -ing forms of verbs in the same way that we use nouns – as the subject, object or complement of a verb. We often refer to-ing forms used in this way as gerunds:

- **Subject** of the sentences
    - **Swimming** is good for you
    - Winning isn’t everything, but wanting it is
    - Eating a lot of fruit is important
- **After verbs** (ofen like, love, enjoy, prefer, hate, can’t stand, don’t like) as an **object**
    - I like playing tennins;
    - I just love winning;
    - I hate losing;
    - I love waking in the mountains;
    - The hardest thing about learning English **is understanding** the gerund;
    - One of life's pleasures **is having** breakfast in bed;
    - **Only a gerund can follow these verbs:**
        - admit, advise, avoid, be used to, can’t help, can’t stand, consider, deny, discuss, dislike, end up, enjoy, feel like, finish, forget, get used to, give up, go on, have difficulty, have problems, have trouble, imagine, it’s no use, it’s worthwhile, keep, look forward to, mention, mind, miss, recommend, remember, quit, spend time, stop, suggest, understand, waste time, work at.
- **After a preposition (complement)**
    - I’m very good at playing tennis
    - I’m good at learning languages
    - Everyone else is afraid of winning
- Gerund in **compound nouns**
    - I am giving Sally a **driving lesson**.
    - They have a **swimming pool** in their back yard.
    - I bought some new **running shoes**.
- Gerund after some expressions
    - She **couldn't help falling** in love with him.
    - I **can't stand being** stuck in traffic jams.
    - It's **no use trying** to escape.
    - It might **be worth phoning** the station to check the time of the train.

### Grammar `would`

The word `would` can be used for functions, such as:

- expressing desire, polite requests and questions, opinion or hope, wish, regret and future ambitions
    - I’d like to visit Kenya next year
    - She wouldn’t like to work in a office when she leaves the school
