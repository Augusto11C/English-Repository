### Grammar - Colloction

Collocation means a natural combination of words; it refers to the way English words are closely associated with each other. For example `tall` goes with `man/woman` and `high` with `mountain`

We can only use certain nouns with certain verbs. These are called collocations.

- Ex:
    - go fishing but not do fishing or play fishing

**Lexical Collocation**

- A **lexical collocation** is a type of construction where a verb, noun, adjective or adverb forms a predictable connection with another word, as in:
    - **adverb + adjective**: completely satisfied (NOT downright satisfied)
        - It’s **highly unlikely** that we’ll have a holiday this year
        - She’s **seriously ill** in hospital
    - **adjective + noun**: excruciating pain (NOT excruciating joy)
        - He made a **full recovery** and was out of the hospital in three days
    - noun + verb: lions roar (NOT lions shout)
    - **verb + noun**: commit suicide (NOT undertake suicide)
        - Almost 1% of the population has **tested positive** for Covid.
        - She had a lot of fun **breaking the rules** at school.
        - Lots of people **paid** her a **compliment** after her fantastic speech

**Grammatical Collocation**

- A **grammatical collocation** is a type of construction where for example a verb or adjective must be followed by a particular preposition, or a noun must be followed by a particular form of the verb, as in:
    - **verb + preposition:** depend on (NOT depend ~~of~~)
    - **adjective + preposition:** afraid of (NOT afraid ~~at~~)
    - **noun + particular form of verb:** strength to lift it (not strength ~~lifting it~~)

- **things happening at the moment of speaking**
    - He’s watching the new on TV at the moment
    - I have to change my shoes. These are killing me. I’m sure I have a blister
- t**hings happening around now but not necessarily at the moment of speaking and long actions in progress now**: the present continuous is used to express an action that is happening over a period of time and is in progress as we speak. However it may not be taking place at the moment of speaking.
