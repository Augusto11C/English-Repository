### Grammar - Colloction

Collocation means a natural combination of words; it refers to the way English words are closely associated with each other. For example `tall` goes with `man/woman` and `high` with `mountain`

We can only use certain nouns with certain verbs. These are called collocations.

- Ex:
    - go fishing but not do fishing or play fishing

**Lexical Collocation**

- A **lexical collocation** is a type of construction where a verb, noun, adjective or adverb forms a predictable connection with another word, as in:
    - **adverb + adjective**: completely satisfied (NOT downright satisfied)
        - It’s **highly unlikely** that we’ll have a holiday this year
        - She’s **seriously ill** in hospital
    - **adjective + noun**: excruciating pain (NOT excruciating joy)
        - He made a **full recovery** and was out of the hospital in three days
    - noun + verb: lions roar (NOT lions shout)
    - **verb + noun**: commit suicide (NOT undertake suicide)
        - Almost 1% of the population has **tested positive** for Covid.
        - She had a lot of fun **breaking the rules** at school.
        - Lots of people **paid** her a **compliment** after her fantastic speech

**Grammatical Collocation**

- A **grammatical collocation** is a type of construction where for example a verb or adjective must be followed by a particular preposition, or a noun must be followed by a particular form of the verb, as in:
    - **verb + preposition:** depend on (NOT depend ~~of~~)
    - **adjective + preposition:** afraid of (NOT afraid ~~at~~)
    - **noun + particular form of verb:** strength to lift it (not strength ~~lifting it~~)
    

### Grammar - Present Continuous

Use the present continuous to talk about:

- **things happening at the moment of speaking**
    - He’s watching the new on TV at the moment
    - I have to change my shoes. These are killing me. I’m sure I have a blister
- t**hings happening around now but not necessarily at the moment of speaking and long actions in progress now**: the present continuous is used to express an action that is happening over a period of time and is in progress as we speak. However it may not be taking place at the moment of speaking.
    - I’m learning French
    - Vick’s travelling to several African countries this year
    - The company is moving its offices to a bigger building next month.
- **current trends and changing situations**
    - Fewer people are buying cars this year
    - I feel a bit lost. I've just finished a really good novel and now I’m not reading anything.
- **near future**:  the present continuous can be used to indicate that something will or will not happen in the near future. The Present Continuous indicates that the action has been agreed on or is a fixed arrangement in the future.
    - I am meeting my friends after work.
    - He is not going to the party tonight.
    - They are traveling to Japan next month.
- **repetition and irritation (always):** with 'always', 'constantly' etc. expresses the idea that something **irritating** or upsetting often happens. This tends to have a negative emotion. 'Always' and 'constantly' are placed in front of the main verb, after 'BE’
    - She is always coming to the office late
    - He is constantly talking
    - They’re always complaining
    

**Spelling rules Present Continuous**

- for most verbs, add `-ing`
- for verbs ending in a `consonant + vowel + consonant` **double the last letter** of the ver and add -`ing`
    - sit → sitting, run → running
- for verbs ending in `-e` , delete the final `e` and add `-ing`
    - make → making, write → writing
