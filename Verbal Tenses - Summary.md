* [Regular unplanned events](regular-unplanned-events)
* [Change](change)

### Events at the time of speaking
We use the present continuous to talk about events which are in progress at the moment of speaking.

> He is pressing the button but nothing is happening.

### Temporary states
We use the present continuous to talk about temporary states which are true around the moment of speaking.

### Change
We use the present continuous to talk about a gradual change

> Maria, 37, is getting better and doctors are optimistic she will make a full recovery.
> Recent evidence suggests that the economic situation is improving.

### Regular unplanned events
We often use the present continuous with words like always, constantly, continually and forever (adverbs of indefinite frequency) to describe events which are regular but not planned, and often not wanted

> My wife, she’s always throwing things out. I like to keep everything.
> I’m constantly spilling things.

### Plans and arrangements
We use the present continuous to refer to the future when we talk about plans and arrangements that have already been made

## Past Continues
* [Events happening at a particular time in the past](events-happening-at-a-particular-time-in-the-past)
* [Context or Reason for Events - Background](context-or-reason-for-events---background)
* [Ongoing and repeated events - Background](ongoing-and-repeated-events---background)
* [Past continues and Adverbs -> Indicate Past Habits](past-continues-and-adverbs--%3E-indicate-past-habits)

### Events happening at a particular time in the past
We generally use the past continuous to _talk about_ **actions and states in progress (happening) around a particular time in the past.** It can emphasise that the action or state continued for a period of time in the past

> A: Where was Donna last night?
> B: I’m not sure. I think she was visiting her family.

> I remember that night. You were wearing that red dress. (state)

### Context or Reason for Events - Background
We often use the past continuous to give a reason or context for an event:

> A: I can’t believe you met Fran and Dave in Portugal.
>
> B: It was funny. They *were staying* in the hotel next to ours. (giving a reason/context for meeting them)

> I didn’t make the meeting last week; I was travelling to Rome.

### Ongoing and repeated events - Background
We can use the past continuous to talk about **repeated background events in the past**. It can suggest that the situation was temporary or subject to change:

> She was feeding her neighbours’ cat every morning while they were on holiday. Then one morning, it was gone.

**Warning**
We only use the past continuous for **repeated background events**. If they are **repeated main events**, we use the **past simple:**

> I **phoned** you four times last night. Where were you?
>
>_Not: I was phoning you four times last night._


### Past continues and Adverbs -> Indicate Past Habits
Adverbs such as always, constantly, forever are used with the past continuous when we talk about repeated, unplanned or undesired events:

> We were always spending so much time in traffic. That’s the main reason why we decided to move to the country and work from home.
> My boss was constantly phoning me in my last job. I hated it.
>  She was forever losing her keys.

## Past Continuous + Past Simple

* When we use these two tenses together, it shows us that the **past simple** action **happened** in the **middle** of the **past continuous** action, while it was in progress.
> _While I was studying, I suddenly felt sleepy._

* These tenses are used together to show an action interrupting another action;
> I was going to my home, I saw a car crash.
> We were watching television when the power went off.
> I was listening to the radio when Helen phoned.

## Present Perfect
We use the present perfect simple to refer to events in the past but which connect to the present.
