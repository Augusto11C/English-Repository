## Present Continuous
We use am, are, is + the -ing form of the verb.

* Plans and arrangements
* Regular unplanned events
* Change
* Temporary states
* Events at the time of speaking

### Events at the time of speaking
We use the present continuous to talk about events which are in progress at the moment of speaking.

> He is pressing the button but nothing is happening.

### Temporary states
We use the present continuous to talk about temporary states which are true around the moment of speaking.

> I'm developing the notification feature of this app.

### Change
We use the present continuous to talk about a gradual change

> Maria, 37, is getting better and doctors are optimistic she will make a full recovery.
> Recent evidence suggests that the economic situation is improving.

### Regular unplanned events
We often use the present continuous with words like always, constantly, continually and forever (adverbs of indefinite frequency) to describe events which are regular but not planned, and often not wanted

> My wife, she’s always throwing things out. I like to keep everything.
> I’m constantly spilling things.

### Plans and arrangements
We use the present continuous to refer to the future when we talk about plans and arrangements that have already been made

> We’re moving to Cambridge in July.

## Past Continues

### Events happening at a particular time in the past
We generally use the past continuous to _talk about_ **actions and states in progress (happening) around a particular time in the past.** It can emphasise that the action or state continued for a period of time in the past

> A: Where was Donna last night?
> B: I’m not sure. I think she was visiting her family.

> I remember that night. You were wearing that red dress. (state)
