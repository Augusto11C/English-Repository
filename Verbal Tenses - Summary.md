## Past Continues
* [Events happening at a particular time in the past](events-happening-at-a-particular-time-in-the-past)
* [Context or Reason for Events - Background](context-or-reason-for-events---background)
* [Ongoing and repeated events - Background](ongoing-and-repeated-events---background)
* [Past continues and Adverbs -> Indicate Past Habits](past-continues-and-adverbs--%3E-indicate-past-habits)

### Events happening at a particular time in the past
We generally use the past continuous to _talk about_ **actions and states in progress (happening) around a particular time in the past.** It can emphasise that the action or state continued for a period of time in the past
> A: Where was Donna last night?
> B: I’m not sure. I think she was visiting her family.

> I remember that night. You were wearing that red dress. (state)

### Context or Reason for Events - Background
We often use the past continuous to give a reason or context for an event:
> A: I can’t believe you met Fran and Dave in Portugal.
> B: It was funny. They *were staying* in the hotel next to ours. (giving a reason/context for meeting them)

> I didn’t make the meeting last week; I was travelling to Rome.

### Ongoing and repeated events - Background
We can use the past continuous to talk about **repeated background events in the past**. It can suggest that the situation was temporary or subject to change:
> She was feeding her neighbours’ cat every morning while they were on holiday. Then one morning, it was gone.

**Warning**
We only use the past continuous for **repeated background events**. If they are **repeated main events**, we use the **past simple:**
> I **phoned** you four times last night. Where were you?
>_Not: I was phoning you four times last night._

### Past continues and Adverbs -> Indicate Past Habits
Adverbs such as always, constantly, forever are used with the past continuous when we talk about repeated, unplanned or undesired events:
> We were always spending so much time in traffic. That’s the main reason why we decided to move to the country and work from home.
> My boss was constantly phoning me in my last job. I hated it.
>  She was forever losing her keys.


## Past Continuous + Past Simple

* When we use these two tenses together, it shows us that the **past simple** action **happened** in the **middle** of the **past continuous** action, while it was in progress.
> _While I was studying, I suddenly felt sleepy._

* These tenses are used together to show an action interrupting another action;
> I was going to my home, I saw a car crash.
> We were watching television when the power went off.
> I was listening to the radio when Helen phoned.


## Present Perfect
We use the present perfect simple to refer to events in the past but which connect to the present.

### Present Perfect - Time up to now
Use present perfect to talk about time up to now, that is, events that took place in the past, but somehow are connected with the present.

## Present Perfect Continuous
> We use _have/has_ + _been_ + the -_ing_ form of the verb.

### Recent past activities
Actions which have **recently stopped** (though the whole action can be unfinished) and **have a result**.
**Using the present perfect continuous focuses on the activity.**
> I am completely soaked, I have just been cleaning the car.
> I've been running, so I'm really hot.

### Temporary Habits or Situations - 
We use the present perfect continuous for activities that began at a point in the past and are still continuing, **but we don't answer the questions about 'how long' so clearly**.
> I've been reading a lot recently.
> I’ve been watching Breaking Bad – it’s great. 
> They've been living with his mother while they look for a house.
> We have been doing extra shift to deliver the project.

> She's been working here since 2004.
> We've been waiting for the bus for hours.

> A: How long have you been waiting for me?

[https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/gramatica/gramatica-britanica/present-perfect-simple-or-present-perfect-continuous](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/gramatica/gramatica-britanica/present-perfect-simple-or-present-perfect-continuous)
These sentences are both used for finished and unfinished actions.

**Present Perfect** can be used (often with "since" or "for") to talk about unfinished actions started in the past and still true in the present.
> I've known John for three years.
> Augusto has lived in Sweden for three years.

**Present Perfect Continuous** can be also used to talk about unfinished actions started in the past and still true. However, it is not possible use the present perfect continuous with stative verbs
> He has been living here for three years.
> Augusto has been living in Swedish for three years. -- NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS AND THE PHRASE : Augusto has lived in Sweden for three years.

### Using Present Perfect Continues to Emphasise the Length of Time that has Passed
> They've been waiting for hours (This emphasises the length of time).
> They've waited for fours (This doesn't emphasise the length of time).

### Using Present Perfect when talk about *How Much* or *How Many*
> She has drunk three cups of coffe this morning. This is not possible with Present Perfect Continues
> WRONG!! ~~She has been drinking three cups of coffe this morning~~

### Present Perfect Continues and Focus on the Action.
 The present perfect continuous often focuses on the action itself, while the present perfect simple focuses on the fact that the action is completed.
>I've been reading the book you recommended. (I'm enjoying it, but I'm not finished).
>I've read the book you recommended. (I've finished it, so we can talk about it).

> I've been studying English recently
> I've studied English recently

### Action is Finished  - Present Perfect
The present perfect simple is used when the action is finished, and the result comes from the action being finished
> We've eaten dinner, so let's go out
> She has done all her homework, so she can relax this evening
> 

### Action is Finished or Not Focus on the Result From the Action - Present Perfect Continuous
> We've been eating dinner, so there are plates all over the table
> She has been doing her homework, so she is tired

## Past Perfect Continuous
### Started in the past and continued up to antoher action/time in the past

> She had been working at that company for a year when she met James.
> I'd been walking for hours when I finally found the house.

### Something that finished just before another event in the past - Result in the past
